# probability.io
> Probability.io wants to provide independent third-party certification   
to enable other projects using our service to ensure that the probability of every roll in the banner is matching their claiming.   

### Here is a User Story.   
> Gaming Platform A can mint an NFT that will represent this New Year Skin banner probability is trustable. 
like Epic Skin is 0.01%, Rare Skin is 10% , Normal Skin is 60% etc...

Let's use chatGPT help use to set the roadmap of this project.
Divide and Conquer it!   

1. Define the certification process: First, you'll need to define the process for third-party certification. This might involve creating a set of criteria that the gaming platform must meet to be certified, such as using your NFT-based banner probability service, providing access to transaction data, and meeting security standards.

2. Build the certification service: Once you've defined the certification process, you'll need to build a web-based certification service that allows gaming platforms to apply for certification. The service should guide the platform through the certification process and provide feedback on areas that need improvement.

3. Develop the smart contract: You'll need to develop a smart contract that mints the NFT for the banner probability and records the transaction data on the blockchain. The smart contract should be audited to ensure that it's secure and meets best practices.

4. Integrate the certification service with the smart contract: You'll need to integrate the certification service with the smart contract to verify that the banner probability data is accurate and matches the NFT metadata. This might involve using an oracle to fetch data from the blockchain and comparing it to the NFT metadata.

5. Build the user interface: You'll need to build a user interface for the certification service that allows gaming platforms to apply for certification, track their progress, and receive feedback. The interface should be user-friendly and easy to navigate.

6. Test and deploy the certification service: Once you've completed development, you'll need to thoroughly test the certification service to ensure that it works as expected. You can use testing frameworks like Jest or Cypress to automate testing. Once you're satisfied with the service, you can deploy it to a hosting provider like AWS or Google Cloud.

7. Market the certification service: Finally, you'll need to market the certification service to attract gaming platforms that are interested in providing independent third-party certification for their banner probability data. You can use social media, forums, and targeted advertising to reach your target audience.

These seven steps sounds not too bad. Following it to implement our side project.
